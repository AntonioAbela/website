    <p>As people become more involved with underwater photography/videography and underwater exploration, the interest has grown for personal underwater drones and remote operated vehicles (ROVs). Submersible drone prices range from anywhere between $499 and $10,000 and they possess many features ranging from max depth, to camera quality, to weight. These are my reviews on which drones you should buy and why you should buy them.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Chasing Innovation Dory</h2>
    <p>If you're just getting into submersible drones as a novice, a popular option is the Chasing Innovation Dory. This drone is the cheapest drone on the market at $499 and it only weighs 2.5 kg. With a battery life of 1 hour and a max depth of 15m, this ROV moves at a max of 1.5 knots and has a camera that films video in 1080p.</p>

    <h2>Chasing F1 Fish Finder</h2>
    <p>The next drone on the list is the perfect drone for fishers. The Chasing F1 Fish Finder is a 2 kg ROV that provides you with information about the surrounding underwater terrain and the location of fish in the water. With a max depth of 28 meters, they can use this in the ocean and lakes. This drone also comes with a camera that films on 1080p and livestreams at 720p.</p>

    <h2></h2>
    <p>The next few drones are similar in purpose and price range. They includeâ€‹ the YouCan Robot BW Space Pro 4K, PowerVision PowerRay Explorer, PowerVision PowerRay Wizard, Chasing Innovation Gladius Mini, NAVATICS MITO, Geneinno Titan ROV, FIFISH, and the OPENROV Trident. </p>
    <br>
    </p>
    <p>The prices of these robots are from $848 - $1699 and I listed them from cheapest to most expensive.</p>
    <p>The YouCan robot is a good photography robot, but it doesn't have much maneuverability.</p>
