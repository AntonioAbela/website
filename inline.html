    Inline Elements
</h1>
<span>
    <p>Inline elements are used to markup text inside a block element like a paragraph of division. Each element does different thing to the text.<strong>This text is in a strong element.</strong><b>This text is in a bold (b) element</b>Bold and strong have the same effect<em>This is emphasised (em) text.</em> It seems to look the same as this <i>italicized text here.</i></p>
    
</span>

<span>
    <p>Putting text inside quote elements, <q>like this quoted text here</q>, makes the text display with quotation marks around it. Code (code) tags are meant for source code examples. They look like <code>code text here.</code> The keyboard element (kbd) looks the same, <kbd>keyboard text here,</kbd> but is meant for examples of user entered data.</p>
</span>
<p>Superscript and subscript elements do what they say.<sup>this is superscript</sup> and <sub>this is subscript.</sub></p>
<p>Span elements don't look like they did anything.</p>
