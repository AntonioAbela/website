    <h1>Special Characters</h1>
<p>Since &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; have special meaning in HTML, you can't use these characters to represent themselves. Instead, you need yo use the so called <q>special characters</q> to represent them. For example, to have a less than sign appear in your document, you need to use &amp;lt; to represent it.</p>
