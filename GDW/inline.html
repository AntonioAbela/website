    Inline Elements
</h1>
<section>
<p>Inline elements are used to markup text inside a block element like a paragraph of division. Each element does different thing to the text.<strong> This text is in a strong element.</strong><b> This text is in a bold (b) element.</b> Bold and strong have the same effect.<em> This is emphasised (em) text.</em> It seems to look the same as this <i>italicized text here.</i></p>
   
<p>Putting text inside quote elements, <q>like this quoted text here</q>, makes the text display with quotation marks around it. Code (code) tags are meant for source code examples. They look like <code>code text here.</code> The keyboard element (kbd) looks the same, <kbd>keyboard text here,</kbd> but is meant for examples of user entered data.</p>

<p>Superscript and subscript elements do what they say.<sup>this is superscript</sup> and <sub>this is subscript.</sub></p>

<p>Span <span style="color: green;">elements</span> don't look like they did anything.</p>
