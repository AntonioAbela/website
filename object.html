<h1>Never Gonna Give You Up</h1>
<p>by Rick Astley</p>

<p>We're no strangers to love<br>
    You know the rules and so do I<br>
    A full commitment's what I'm thinking of<br>
    You wouldn't get this from any other guy<br></p>
    
<p>I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br>
    Gotta make you understand<br></p>
<p>Never gonna give you up<br>
    Never gonna let you down<br>
    Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
    Never gonna make you cry<br>
    Never gonna say goodbye<br>
    Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br></p>
<p>We've known each other for so long<br>
    Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it<br>
    Inside, we both know what's been going on<br>
    We know the game, and we're gonna play it<br></p>
    <p>etc...</p>
